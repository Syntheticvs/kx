#AOG_battleship_4_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of the Second Weltkrieg, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16") guns."
AOG_carrier_1:0 "Flugzeugdampfer I"
#AOG_carrier_1_desc:0 "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Airplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of the Weltkrieg. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
AOG_carrier_2:0 "Seydlitz Class"
#AOG_carrier_2_desc:0 "Seydlitz was laid down as the fourth ship of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers. Partially completed by the beginning of the war, she was considered for conversion into an aircraft carrier. The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
AOG_carrier_3:0 "Graf Zeppelin Class"
#AOG_carrier_3_desc:0 "Graf Zeppelin was the only class of ships in the Kaiserliche Marine that had been designed as an aircraft carrier from the keel up. Two ships were ordered, but neither was completed. As designed, the Graf Zeppelin would carry 30 Bf-109T fighters and 12 Ju-87E dive bombers, ship versions of the Bf-109E and the Ju-87D."
AOG_carrier_4:0 "Europa Class"
#AOG_carrier_4_desc:0 "Several civilian ships were considered for conversions to aircraft carriers by the Kaiserliche Marine in the 1940s. The largest of these ships was the passenger ship Europa. Being the largest passenger ship in Germany, she had been used as a barracks ship and a troop transport before work began on converting her to a carrier. Had she been completed, she would have displaced 56,000 tons and carried an air group of 42 aircraft."
AOG_SH_battleship_1:0 "Schlachtschiff H41"
#AOG_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armour, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
AOG_SH_battleship_2:0 "Schlachtschiff H44"
#AOG_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs. With no limit on gun caliber or displacement, the H42 to H44 designs mounted increasingly heavier armament and armour protection, culminating in the 131,000 ton H44 design armed with eight 508mm (20") guns."

The Ar 576 feautres a unique engine design whereby all four jet engines are inlaid in the wing of the aircraft; it was the jarring sound these engines make when spinning up, a sound like that of a hammer being slammed against the fuselage, that the Ar 576 earned the nickname 'hammer' among German test pilots."
