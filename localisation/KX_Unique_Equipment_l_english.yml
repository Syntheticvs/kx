AFG_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Mauser M1887"
AFG_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mauser Model 1871 was the Mauser brothers' first rifle. It was adopted by the German Empire as the Gewehr 71 or Infanterie-Gewehr 71. The Turkish model of 1887 was a further refinement of the past German design and was the first of a series of rifles produced for the Turkish Army. Unfortunately, at the time of its adoption it was already technologically obsolete as all of Europe was racing to re-arm with small caliber, smokeless powder cartridge rifles.\n\nSeeing as the Ottomans had no more use for it, leftover rifles were sent to the Afghan front to aid in the defense against a counterattack by the British Raj, where it earned a very positive reputation by its Afghani users."

AFG_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "Mauser T98 was the main service rifle of the Ottoman Army during the Weltkrieg. The Ottoman M1903, chambered in 7.65mm, was the most common variant of Mauser in use. Pronounced 'Mavzer' by the Ottomans, this iconic rifle achieved great fame and became deeply ingrained in the Turkish subconscious.\n\nHowever, as the need for a more modern rifle became more and more apparent, the Ottoman military began selling the obselete rifles to their Afghan allies."
AFG_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Selbstladegewehr 40"
AFG_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "Selbstlader 40"
AFG_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed by the Mauser company in response to a German Army desire for a self-loading rifle with a backup bolt action, the Selbstladegewehr 40 was a massive leap forward in German small arms design. While initial prototypes were highly inaccurate, heavy, and prone to jamming, the German army eventually dropped some its other specific requirements for the rifle, and the end result, the predecessor the rifle that would ultimately be adopted, proved effective."
AFG_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Fallschirmjägergewehr 42"
AFG_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "FG-42"
AFG_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The FG 42 or 'Fallschirmjägergewehr 42' is a selective-fire 7.92×57mm Mauser automatic rifle produced in both the German Empire and Afghanistan. There were never enough FG 42s produced in Germany to arm most Fallschirmjäger as originally intended, however most were instead produced and deployed along the Afghan-Persian border during the Ottoman campaign. Though rare and expensive to produce, the Afghan command remained enthusiastic about its lighter weight, comparatively long barrel, and controllable automatic fire."

jezail_equipment_0_desc:0 "Jezails are generally handmade weapons, and are consequently widely varied in their construction. Jezails are seen as very personal weapons, and unlike most military weapons which are plain and utilitarian, jezails tend to be well-crafted and intricately decorated. The jezail is a muzzle-loading long arm that typically has a smooth bore and its firing mechanism is usually either a matchlock or a flintlock. The Jezail is an archaic weapon in this day and age."

Coming from the Powhatan word tamahaac derived from the Proto-Algonquian root ‘temah’ meaning ‘to cut off by tool’ and related to other Alongquian cognates that all translate to ‘axe’, the tomahawk and other edged-weapons like it shall serve us well in our fight for retribution as they have for our ancestors for hundreds of years, while many shall also serve us in peacetime as they are ornately carved and used as art pieces or ceremonial peace pipes."

Made of heavy tropical wood, these three to four-foot long clubs are adorned with prismatic blades traditionally made from obsidian, holding an edge sharper than a steel blade powered by the dense, massive swings of the mace behind it. Able to cleave bone and sever limbs, the Macuahuitl and other traditional Mexica weapons like the atl-atl spear thrower shall help us turn the tide."

Korol’kov, and the Deutsche Luftstreitkräfte, these state-of-the-art artillery pieces utilize electromagnetic propulsion via a pair of charged parallel bus bars that connect to the wings of the launching projectile, creating a new form of weaponry that relies not on the chemical energy of gunpowder, but the electrical energy of the modern age. Requiring ludicrous amounts of power and being highly immobile due to relying on mass towing or railroad to move, they can only be powered by our biggest hydroelectric dams and experimental nuclear reactors, but what they lack in reliability and mobility is more than compensated for in their raw destructive potential."
