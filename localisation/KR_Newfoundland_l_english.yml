NFL_bad_economy:0 "Bad Economy"
NFL_bad_economy_desc:0 "Attributed to our unfortunate economic reliance on the fish, paper, and mineral exports, and our lack of any industrial or population centers, Newfoundland has forced us into economic hardship. Our economic situation was only worsened by the American Great Depression, and while while the Depression wreaked havoc on our and Canada's economy, it did not fully cripple our nation's economy. With any hope our nation will recover, slowly."

NFL_great_depression:0 "Ruined Economy"
NFL_great_depression_desc:0 "The Great Depression was a hurdle we could have overcome, however just when we seemed to be on the path to recovery,  the crippling Black Monday depression completely eviscerated our fragile economy. The few markets we have access to no longer want to purchase our products, and our creditors don't have enough funds to sustain our economy. We have few assets to our credit, and if we wish to dig ourselves out of this hoe we must work hard. "

NFL_reliance_on_canada:0 "Reliance on Canada"
NFL_reliance_on_canada_desc:0 "Newfoundland has little in terms of domestic resources, leaving us completely reliant on our larger neighbor, the Dominion/Kingdom of Canada. Newfoundland for better or for worse is unbreakably bonded to our elder sibling within the Empire."

NFL_memories_of_the_regiment:0 "Legacy of the Newfoundland Regiment"
NFL_memories_of_the_regiment_desc:0 "Our own Royal Newfoundland Regiment has a storied tradition of bad luck. First suffering cataclysmic losses at Gallipoli, and then losing 90 percent of the regiment during the first Battle of the Somme. Our poor performance in the Weltkreig has been a source of shame for our army, who sees the need to prepare properly for a conflict as paramount. "
