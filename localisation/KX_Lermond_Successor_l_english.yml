NEE_the_death_of_lermund_desc:0 "Finally giving up the ghost and leaving this great nation he has built behind, Norman Wallace Lermond has died, and now we are cast adrift without direction. We must move to announce a new successor to Lermond in order to complete his term, but now the only question that remains is as to who must be chosen. The three main factions competing for the seat are varied. The majority force are the orthodox ‘Lermondites’, run by Henry A. Pilsbry, along with figures like the young up-and-comer Barry Commoner and and prodigal son of a long-time Lermond ally Harvey Bulfinch Lovell. Opposing them are the industrial Syndicalists led by Erwin ‘Harry’ Ault, who wish to undo Lermond’s severe agrarian slant, and Paul Goodman, who leads a group of young ‘Green’ Anarchists that seek to accelerate Lermond’s vision even further. Who shall win is anyone’s guess, but whoever rises to the top will dictate our new destiny."
NEE_the_age_of_reason:0 "Triumph of the Industrialists"
NEE_the_age_of_reason_desc:0 "Shocking the core of Lermond’s support base and the late leader’s allies alike, Harry Ault has somehow convinced the people of New England, and more importantly party officials, that the best way forward in the wake of Lermond’s death is to adhere to his teachings and utopian ideals while reducing the emphasis on agrarianism and replacing it with a hard industrial focus. Citing the strong nascent industry that New Englands holds within our borders, Ault has roused the people to wake the sleeping machines of our dormant factories, for the way towards prosperity shall be atop the black smog of progress!"
NEE_lermunds_heir:0 "The Oak Stands Strong!"
NEE_lermunds_heir_desc:0 "The central core of our Party, now dubbed the ‘Lermondites’ in reverence to our late leader and nicknamed the ‘Iron Oaks’ in respect to their stalwart and unyielding dedication to the central pillars of Lermond’s message, have won out in the internal power struggle. Now, New England is theirs to guide and shape in Lermond’s image, of course with their own unique twists. Before these dedicated loyalists can begin however, a leader shall be chosen amongst themselves, for their coalition to save Lermond’s dream from radicals now has no purpose with Ault and Goodman defeated. But before we stoop to yet another power struggle, let us first reaffirm the legacy of our late leaders and enshrine his views eternally."
NEE_syndicalism_with_lermunds_characteristics:0 "Hyper-Industrializing the Colonies"
NEE_syndicalism_with_lermunds_characteristics_desc:0 "In-line with Ault’s vision for New England, Lermond’s stagnating agrarian policies shall be partially repealed to make way for a slew of new industrialization efforts aimed at turning New England into the new industrial heartland of the American continent. From new factories and dockyards to new heavy infrastructure and massive urbanization efforts, New England shall stay in line with the principles of humanistic and populist democratic Eco-Socialism, but with a heavy, almost contradictory stance on rapid and mass industrialization that would put the Rust Belt to shame."
NEE_the_new_labor_movement:0 "The New Labor Movement"
NEE_the_new_labor_movement_desc:0 "Seeking to distinguish himself from other, failed Socialist movements that plague the current wave of American Leftism, Ault has begun to revive old ideas picked up from his time in Washington State and Chicago. Recreating the Wage Workers Party, the WWP was once a fusion of SLP and IWW doctrine aimed at uplifting the working class of America, limiting its membership to only wage workers in order to exclude the hidden bourgeois. Reborn again, the WWP shall protect the true backbone of this nation, forming a new form of Labor movement here in New England - one form-fit to our realities and ready to face the challenges ahead as we seek to reform the state."
NEE_in_memory_of_ferrer:0 "Inspirations from Chicago"
NEE_in_memory_of_ferrer_desc:0 "Chicago is the bastion and beacon of Leftist thought in America, and though they have made mistakes, they are still the gold, or crimson, standard when it comes to modeling Americanist Socialism. As such, we shall look to the policies of the Combined Syndicates and the SPA, learning from their mistakes and succeeding where they could not. We shall perfect Americanized Socialism by building off the shoulders of these giants."
NEE_the_nation_of_immigrant_socialist:0 "Ties with Foster"
NEE_the_nation_of_immigrant_socialist_desc:0 "William Z. Foster is one of the brightest minds when it comes to Industrial Unionism and Syndicalism in America. Having had previously established a professional relationship during their brief time working together in the former WWP, it would be foolish not to draw closer to this titan of Leftism in America. We shall emulate some of Foster’s best ideas while working with his own TUUL in order to bring proletarian paradise to New England."
NEE_rally_the_unions:0 "In Memory of Lermond"
NEE_rally_the_unions_desc:0 "We must never forget Norman Wallace Lermond, for he is the founder and father of our modern movement. No matter where our future path leads us, and no matter how far we may stray from his original goals, that shall matter not, for Lermond shall always be respected as the founding figure that laid the foundations that our future utopia shall be built upon. All hail Lermond!"
NEE_supporting_the_colonies:0 "Supporting the Colonies"
NEE_supporting_the_colonies_desc:0 "Though we have many jobs to perform here before we can truly achieve utopia, there is one above all that must be addressed. We must move to take care of each and every soul within our borders with a strong welfare state and Socialist populism and economic egalitarianism, for that is our most basic and most important duty. By our hand, we shall nurture the people of these collectivized colonies and build a paradise unlike any other."
NEE_the_flight_of_the_bumblebee:0 "The Young Jeffersonians"
NEE_the_flight_of_the_bumblebee_desc:0 "Surpassing the Lermondite core and Ault’s Industrialists, the Young Jeffersonians led by radical Eco-Anarchist and philosopher Paul Goodman have risen to take the torch of Lermond’s vision. Under the young firebrand Goodman, New England shall further dive into Eco-Socialism and Agrarianism while further dissolving the apparatus of state as we push closer to pure communalism and anarchism truly in tune with nature and the frontier around us."
NEE_ecological_socialism:0 "Maintaining Eco-Socialism"
NEE_ecological_socialism_desc:0 "No matter how we deviate from Lermond’s original vision, if at all, we must always maintain our foundations as an Eco-Socialist state. Inspired by the Granger movement, Bellamyite utopian thought, conservationism, and other agrarian-minded, ecologically-conscious movements, our administration and all future administrations shall never deviate from our established core. The Proletariat matters as much as the planet does, and we must always care for both in equal measure."
NEE_the_naturalist_state:0 "Lermond’s Pupil"
NEE_the_naturalist_state_desc:0 "Rising above his allies in the oaken Lermondite core, Barry Commoner has risen to lead New England. A young student of Lermond and a brilliant cellular biologist and ecologist in his own right, Commoner and his Citizens Wing are prepared to lead New England in Lermond’s image while also softening some of the most radical policies in order to be in more touch with the common man. Let us hope that this young brainiac has what it takes to fill the shoes of the titans before him."

NEE_honoring_the_maine_naturalist_desc:0 "A play on his own last name, Commoner’s new slogan has become the focal point of his new message. Seeking to include all peoples within our Eco-Socialist society without scaring some off with unnecessary radicalism, Commoner will mold Lermond’s thought into a new form of Environmental Progressivism and Left-Libertarianism. This shall grant all those within our nation the freedoms to live how they please along with the safety nets and opportunities required to do so fully, so long as you do not exercise your freedoms in order to oppress or indecently persuade others."
NEE_the_lermond_prot:0 "Lermond’s Protégé"
NEE_the_lermond_prot_desc:0 "Once one of Lermond’s closest allies and friends, Henry A. Pilsbry has risen to replace his old mentor and dear colleague. A dedicated Biologist, Malacologist, and Carcinologist, Pilsbry worked with Lermond in his American Malacological Union, the Knox Academy of Arts and Sciences, and Utopia Park. With such a closely linked personal and professional history that has spanned decades, Pilbrsy is expected to be the most devoted to Lermond’s core principles. As such, under his rule, the ideas of Lermond shall only continue to spread as they always have, with little deviation expected."
NEE_expanding_the_knox_academy:0 "The People's Biosphere"
NEE_expanding_the_knox_academy_desc:0 "With the core policy of the state already set and only needing maintenance, Pilsbry has moved to pursuits of foreign policy. Announcing the creation of what he calls the ‘People’s Biosphere’, Pilsbry seeks to bring together an assorted group of varied nations that all follow similar Agrarian and Ecological commitments that we do in order to create a new alliance to protect our interests and the wider biosphere of the planet. Together, both the Proletariat and the planet as a whole shall be granted paradise."
NEE_the_lermond_friend:0 "Lermond’s Colleague"
NEE_the_lermond_friend_desc:0 "Rising to lead the nation, the son of famous naturalist and bee expert John Harvey Lovell, our own Harvey Bulfinch Lovell, will now guide the Lermondite core towards a slightly new direction. Lovell’s father was a longtime colleague and contemporary of Lermond, working together for decades before both of their deaths and sharing a love of botany that formed the foundations of their Eco-Socialist views. Now, long taught and inspired by his own father, Harvey has risen to take his place and shares most of his same views, and though Harvey may deviate from Lermond’s original systems, the goal shall remain the same - creating a radical Eco-Socialist utopia here in New England."
NEE_lovells_hive:0 "Lovell’s Hive"
NEE_lovells_hive_desc:0 "Taking notes from both his father’s and his own numerous studies into how bees live, work, and function, Lovell has a radical new place for New England. Our society shall be reorganized around ‘hives’ - each a self-contained and self-sustaining commune aimed at the production of one specific good or set of goods. These hives shall exist all over New England for each and every industry, with the experts in each field serving as guides for the masses. By working together in unison, our hive nodes shall cooperate as one national ‘mega-hive’ capable of meeting the needs of each and every drone in our swarm without needing to be blockaded by inefficiencies present in other, lesser systems."
NEE_doctrine_of_eusocialism:0 "Industrial Society and Its Plight"
NEE_doctrine_of_eusocialism_desc:0 "Industrial Society and its plight have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in ‘advanced’ countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological and physical suffering, and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development along this path will only worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in ‘advanced’ countries. As such, Industrial Society must be observed and refined so that these inhumane acts can finally be undone. We must progress forward while also returning in some ways to a more sustainable system."

NEE_the_new_synthesis_desc:0 "Professing a new, second Enlightenment far greater than the first, Goodman has begun to introduce his own unique views on philosophy, morality, liberty, true freedom, rationality, and more into the public mainstream. With this advocacy, he seeks to trigger a new mental and cultural revolution to sweep New England up in its riptide, bring in a new perception of reality and Socialism to our people.

lermond.1.t:0 "The White-Capped Devils Strike!"
lermond.1.d:0 "Normal Wallace Lermond is one of the most beloved and widely respected men in New England, but despite his widespread popularity and kind heart, there still exists opposition to this elderly titan of utopian Socialism. In the backwoods of Northern Maine, one such group of these detractors congregate - the Maine branch of the Ku Klux Klan. One of the largest KKK brotherhoods in the Northeast, the Maine KKK have long plotted against Lermond’s open, populist, and egalitarian policies, calling him an ally of the Judeo-Syndicalist cabal that tries to control the world. \n\nWith hate in their hearts and with blood on their minds, this northern offshoot of the Maine has plotted to kill our leader, creating a homemade bomb over the past few months with smuggled parts sourced from the black market and their ODP contacts. Planning to place the bomb in Lermond’s own arboretum and setting it to detonate when Lermond is schedule to hold a speech within his personal tree garden, the plan could possibly work. With the team assigned to deliver the payload on their way now, all that remains to be seen is if these backwoods yokels actually managed to create a working and deadly bomb or not."
lermond.1.a:0 "The bomb is disrupted in transit and detonates before reaching Lermond, killing all involved."
lermond.1.b:0 "Somehow, the bomb is safely transported, primed, armed, and detonated. Lermond has died!"

lermond.111.t:0 "The Death of President Lermond"
lermond.111.d:0 "Today, Normal Wallace Lermond, leader of our nation since just after it's birth, has passed away. Found on a bench in his arboretum, Lermond had peacefully died in his sleep, surrounded by the nature he loved so. With his death, our nation is left without leadership, and in his absence, the Central Committee of the Socialist Party has taken control of the presidency until such time a Party Congress can be called. Regardless of Leadership, New England has lost her truest son, and we'll never be the same without him"
lermond.111.a:0 "Godspeed you magnificent bastard"

lermond.2.t:0 "The Inter-Party Election"
lermond.2.d:0 "With the death of President Lermond, the Party has moved to elect a new successor from within their own ranks. The main faction dominating the Party conference has the Lermondite loyalists nicknamed the Old Oaks. They are a group of sworn and devoted Lermondites that seek to guide New England forward with little to no deviation from our original path as set by our fallen father. They are largely dominated by three camps, being the young Left-Libertarian moderates under Lermond’s own student Barry Commoner, the communalist ‘Hiveists’ under Harvey Bulfinch Lovell who is the son of Lermond’s old colleague John and sworn to his late father’s ideals inspired by bee behavior and biology, and the main Lermondite loyalists known as the Oaken Core, which is led by Lermond’s own protégé and life-long friend Henry Augustus Pilsbry. \n\nOpposing this coalition of Lermondites are the two competing radical factions: the Industrialists and the Young Jeffersonians. The Industrialists under Erwin Bratton ‘Harry’ Ault are a group of Forsterite-inspired Syndicalist moderates that seek to capitalize on New England’s nascent industry in order to build an egalitarian worker’s paradise that still respects the environment as per Lermond’s wishes. Opposing the ‘traitors’ to Lermond’s vision are the Young Jeffersonians under the young philosopher and activist Paul Goodman. They seek to accelerate Lermond’s dream by harkening back to America’s frontier and colonial past, creating an ecological anarchist utopia built around cooperating communes. \n\nOnly one faction can truly win out however, so who shall rise to lead New England now in the wake of Lermond’s tragic demise?"
lermond.2.a:0 "Ault and his Industrialists win out."
lermond.2.b:0 "Commoner leads the Lermondites towards moderate progressivism."
lermond.2.c:0 "Pilsbry and the Lermondite Oaken Core stand firm!"
lermond.2.e:0 "Lovell guides the Lermondites towards the science of the Hive."
lermond.2.f:0 "The Young Jeffersonians under Goodman accelerate Lermondite thought to its anarchist end."

lermond.3.t:0 "The Industrialists Start Their Backslide"
lermond.3.d:0 "With the victory of Erwin ‘Henry’ Ault and the Industrialist faction, New England is expected to take a significant departure from core Lermondite principles. New England shall progress towards ‘Eco-Syndicalism’ - a system in which we shall pursue rapid industrialization measures in the urban sprawls of New England while still leaving the vast swathes of our pristine wilderness protected and intact. We shall take measures to combat pollution and environmental damage without compromising the industrial power we can achieve here in this rich corner of America. Loosely tied to Lermond’s wishes, we shall still bring proletarian paradise to our people instead of delusions of utopian paradise."
lermond.3.a:0 "All forward for green industrialization!"

lermond.4.t:0 "The Oaken Core Holds Firm"
lermond.4.d:0 "Surprising no one, the Lermondite Oaken Core has won out in the internal elections, with Pilsbry, Lovell, and Commoner banding together in a coalition in order to stave off the radicals. Now, together and united in their loyalty to Lermondite thought, these titans of Eco-Socialism shall guide New England towards true Bellamy-inspired utopia. Although only one can lead them, and though their dedication to strict Lermondite thought varies, this broad front is as strong and mighty as an old Oak, ready to stand stalwart eternally in order defend New England and to bring utopian egalitarianism and agrarian perfection to our people."
lermond.4.a:0 "Mighty as the Oak, we stand strong against factionalism and revisionist tendencies."

lermond.5.t:0 "The New Labor Movement"
lermond.5.d:0 "Based upon his Wage Worker platform, President Ault has now moved to enact his plan of a New Labor Movement to break from the delusions of Bellamyist utopianism. By departing from the core of Lermond’s influences gathered from Bellamy’s naive form of Socialism, we shall find newfound prosperity by embracing American forms of Syndicalism. An old ally of Foster from their time together in the WWP, we shall adopt many principles of Fosterite Syndicalism while adapting them to fit our decentralized nature and desire to separate the urban industrialized hubs from our idyllic natural preservers. A new central Trade Union Congress shall be established and attached as a new House in the Legislature, representing the rights and needs of the wage-working class. Furthermore, unions - especially industrial and crafts unions - shall be incentivized and endorsed openly by the government, but we shall refrain from restricting the rights of non-union members unlike our European counterparts. We will build an Eco-Syndicalist paradise as we fuse our industrial realities with our environmental concerns."
lermond.5.a:0 "No more delusions of impossible utopias or other fantasies."

lermond.6.t:0 "Tea with Foster"
lermond.6.d:0 "Once political allies and fellow members of the first Wage Workers movement, William Z. Foster and Henry Ault have had a turbulent relationship. After the Wage Workers movement fell apart and was cannibalized by other, stronger Socialist movements, Foster and Ault went their separate ways, occasionally crossing paths until the borders came down during the Second Civil War. As the war raged however, Ault and Foster would sparingly correspond through letters, though Foster usually chastised our leader for being far too moderate. \n\nIn an effort to build cordial relations once more, President Ault has invited Foster over for tea and brunch, and to Ault’s slight surprise, Foster has actually arrived. What started as a smooth and peaceful if stale meeting however soon turned hot as Foster and Ault got into a large debate, or more like screaming match, over whose form of Syndicalism was more beneficial to the working masses. It escalated further, with Foster calling Ault a revisionsity revolutionary traitor and filthy moderate while Ault called Foster a deceitful tyrant and a plague upon the environment. The meeting ended abruptly as curses and familial insults about certain persons’ mothers were exchanged, and with Ault throwing his tea in Foster’s face. It would seem that they would not be meeting again."
lermond.6.a:0 "Typical Leftist infighting."

lermond.7.t:0 "In Memory of Lermond"
lermond.7.d:0 "In a touching eulogy given by [root.getleader], our state and party said a final farewell to our national father and revolutionary hero Norman Wallace Lermond. To commemorate his passing, statues and art of our beloved leader have been erected all across the nation, with his own Knox Arboretum and Knox Academy becoming national monuments and landmarks, while the Arboretum itself now serves as Lermond’s final and ever-verdant resting place. Furthermore, Lermond’s hometown of Warren, Maine has been renamed Lermondville in his honor. All across our utopian state, the people shall cheer and rejoice even without our fallen titan and hero, for we shall live forever in proletarian prosperity thanks to his sacrifice."
lermond.7.a:0 "A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted."

lermond.8.t:0 "Supporting the Colonies"
lermond.8.d:0 "The ‘colonies’ of New England and all the communes and collectives scattered around the nation already do more than enough to meet the needs of the state and our people. As such, we should move only to support and expand the ones that we have now instead of wasting funds in frivolous pursuits that fly in the face of Lermond’s original vision. This shall stabilize our economy in these turbulent times and bring greater long-term economic benefits to the state."
lermond.8.a:0 "Tighten our belts now in order to prosper later."

lermond.9.t:0 "The Young Jeffersonians Ride In"
lermond.9.d:0 "Sidestepping the established Lermondite Oaken Core and the radical revisionist Ault, Paul Goodman and his Young Jeffersonians have risen to lead the Party and New England. An advocate of Ecological Anarchism, Goodman seeks to accelerate Lermondite thought to what he believes is it's inevitable conclusion. Seeing modern pollutive industrialization as a cancer that needs to be cured, Goodman seeks to replace this harmful apparatus with an anarchist system built around frontier democracy and cooperating communes that spread our industry out and limit it to only what is necessary to provide a comfortable well-being for our people so as to not further damage the environment."
lermond.9.a:0 "Our liberty depends on the sanctity of the environment, and that cannot be limited without being lost."

lermond.10.t:0 "Keeping Lermondist Economics"
lermond.10.d:0 "Keeping in line with Lermondite economic doctrines, [root.getleader] has decided to codify Lermond’s theory and ideology into one cohesive and coherent document. This new document shall serve as the framework and foundation of our economy going forward, and shall be based around the Grange and Bellamy-inspired teachings of our fallen leader. Our worker colonies, communes, collectives, and adherence to utopian Eco-Socialism shall never waver or deviate, for these central pillars are what keeps our state stable and prosperous. Even though Lermond is gone, that does not mean that his legacy and teachings end here!"
lermond.10.a:0 "Give us your poor, and we shall build utopia."


lermond.11.t:0 "Commoner's Approach"
lermond.11.d:0 "Rising to the top of the coalition, surprising many due to his young age and seeming inexperience, Barry Commoner seeks to guide New England towards progressive and moderate Left-Libertarianism based squarely in Lermondite Eco-Socialist thought. Trying to bring more people into our movement and seeking to reduce how much our Socialist state alienates much of the masses, Commoner and his ‘Commoner’s Approach’ shall sweep the masses of the everyday common man into our party, shrinking the apparatus and bureaucracy of the state, rolling back stricter and more authoritative laws, and overall bringing our utopian populism to all with greater cohesion and less obstacles than ever before."
lermond.11.a:0 "Full steam ahead with the Commoner’s Approach!"

lermond.12.t:0 "Pilsbry at the Helm"
lermond.12.d:0 "Lifelong friends, colleagues, and scientific associates, Henry Augustus Pilsbry was perhaps Lermond’s greatest ally in the harsh political world of New England. Fellow malacologists, naturalists, and biologists, the two worked with each other on numerous experiments, and co-chaired both the Knox Academy and the Malacological Union. The most devoted of the Lermondite loyalists and least likely to deviate from Orthodox Lermondite Thought, Pilsbry shall instead focus the nation’s attention on something greater. Working with other ecologically-minded nations and movements around the globe, Pilbry shall work towards the creation of the People’s Biosphere - an international alliance of ‘Green’ states. This new alliance shall be the crowning glory and achievement of the Lermondite movement, and we shall work diligently to preserve the world’s ecosystems while making our fallen founding father proud."
lermond.12.a:0 "The Oak stands strong and dedicated to Lermond over all."

lermond.13.t:0 "Lovells Colony of Hives"
lermond.13.d:0 "With his own father being in the Knox Academy with Lermond, Harvey Bulfinch Lovell has been around Lermondite thought for most of his life. Following in his father’s footsteps by diving into the behavioral and biological study of bees as well as Lermondite and Bellamyite principles, Lovell is the most unorthodox of the Lermondite loyalists. He has begun to implement his idea of a network of ‘hives’ that will become the basis of New England society. These ‘hives’ are practically just collectives and communes, each dedicated to a single product, task, industry, or service. Furthermore, each is run by a dedicated Hive King or Queen Bee that serves as the trained and experienced expert that leads the rest of their ‘drones’ in their chosen task. These hives will cooperate in a distributist network, and shall function as the new vehicle of industry, goods, and services. With these bee-based principles being put in place, Lovell will transform New England into a buzzing network of prosperity, efficiency, and utopian egalitarianism."
lermond.13.a:0 "We shall live as the bees do, and be all the better for it."

lermond.14.t:0 "Funding the Pioneers"
lermond.14.d:0 "In order to better prepare the next generation for our way of life and in order to further spread how many partake in our Youth Pioneers and our various collectivist programs, we shall further fund these varied programs set up by Lermond and incentivize new people to join. We shall not force any of our population to live within our new system, but we can persuade people to come to our side of things if we show them just how beneficial and prosperous it can truly be. We will win over the old and the new, one new collective or youth trip at a time."
lermond.14.a:0 "Building utopia was never going to be quick or easy."

lermond.15.t:0 "Industrial Society and its Plight"
lermond.15.d:0 "Paul Goodman has seen the writing on the wall, and knows that our current path - the current path of all humanity - will lead to our downfall. Though he cannot stop the world, he can save our slice of eden here. Revolting against industrial modernity, Paul Goodman has begun a push to decentralize our industry, spreading it across our nation and keeping it to only necessary levels in order to stave off environmental collapse. Furthermore, fossil fuels have begun to be phased out slowly in favor of utilizing the hydroelectric potential of Niagara Falls and the Hudson River, though the engineering behind such feats shall be done carefully to have as little of an environmental impact as possible. Goodman shall build a Ecological Anarchist utopia in line with Lermond’s ultimate dream, and build a verdant, decentralized, collectivized paradise amid the verdant greenery."
lermond.15.a:0 "We shall wage revolution against the industrial system."

lermond.16.t:0 "Yeoman Craftsmanship and Frontier Democracy"
lermond.16.d:0 "Going in line with Goodman’s Yeomen policies, a lot of equipment, products, goods, and foodstuffs in our nation are now being made by local craftsmen, farmers, artisans, and other skilled laborers. Though production output has slowed, we have had far less of an impact on the environment while also moderating our people and teaching them patience - virtues lost in the modern age. Along with these changes, frontier democracy has also taken root, following the lead of our ancestors that laid the noble foundations of this great land. All shall have a voice, and local government provides all as a direct instrument of the decentralized masses, finally freeing the proletariat and the planet of the vices of modernism."
lermond.16.a:0 "All are free and liberated in this green paradise."

lermond.17.t:0 "An Invitation to the Co-operative Commonwealth"
lermond.17.d:0 "We have recieved a delegation in the capital today from 'The Brotherhood of the Co-operative Commonwealth', a formal alliance created by the utopian socialist government of New England. They seek to unite the world's ecological socialists and utopians towards a common goal of preserving world peace. Should we join forces with our 'brothers' or forge our own destiny?"
lermond.17.a:0 "We will build a better future together!"
lermond.17.b:0 "We have no need for their 'brotherhood'"
